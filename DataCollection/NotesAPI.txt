API Stuff:

-API = Application Programming Interface
-An API is built for the server!!!! It is like the post office and the whole point of a server is to be interactered with! It's just
a bunch of blank(headless) computers that are designed and setup to do nothing else but offer assistance for data(mail)!!
-REST = REpresentational State Transfer
-'REST' is probably the most popular 'architectural style of APIs' "for web services"
architectural style of APIs -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API | [https://blog.hubspot.com/website/types-of-apis]
    OBJECTIVE: Client Device wants to access a Web Server
      Web APIs are a "SERVICE" accessed from client devices (Mobile Phones, Laptop, etc.)
      Client devices use Web API services to access speicific Web Servers
      =To interact an with an API 'a program' must do so by conforming to the specific rules and standards of an/by 'HTTP request'
      =Client devices create and send a request in the form of an HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request which accesses specified APIs
-A request is made up of the following components:
    endpoint - The URL that delineates what data you are interacting with(an endpoint URL is tied to a specific resource within an API)
    method - Specifies how you’re interacting with the resource located at the provided endpoint. REST APIs can provide methods to
             enable full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. Here are common methods most REST APIs provide:
                        GET – Retrieve data
                        PUT – Replace data
                        POST – Create data
                        DELETE – Delete data
    data - If you’re using a method that involves changing data in a REST API, you’ll need to include a data payload with the request
           that includes all data that will be created or modified
    headers - Contain any metadata that needs to be included with the request, such as authentication tokens, the content type that
              should be returned, and any caching policies.
-A response
    When you perform a request, you’ll get a response from the API. Just like in the request, it’ll have a response header and
    response data, if applicable. The response header consists of useful metadata about the response, while the response data returns
    what you actually requested. This can be any sort of data, as it’s really dependent on the API. The text is usually returned as
    JSON, but other markdown languages like XML are also possible. 

TERMINAL >  curl -X GET "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
    =response.content() # Return the raw bytes of the data payload
    =response.text() # Return a string representation of the data payload
    =response.json() # This method is convenient when the API returns JSON
