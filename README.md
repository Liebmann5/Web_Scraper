# Summary:
This project is designed to automate the job application process, making it easier and more efficient for users. The only time they insert info is their first time which collects their resume, basic info, and lastly a unqiue summary about their career. The project utilizes ML and SpaCy AI to find and apply to specific jobs the user qualifies for and is interested in. The security is bypassed using OxyLabs(for now) which provides everything from rotational residential IP addesses to CAPTCHA's. The ML adds different answers to every miscellaneous question it comes across while also avoiding security as well by making each answered question unique to each user.

I also built a server that incorporates a FastAPI, MariaDB, data analysis, and output of data to Google Sheets in the form of many useful graphs that provide current insight into the job market in real-time!
