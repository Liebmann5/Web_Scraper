It seems like you're pushing your entire virtual environment to your repository, which is not recommended. The virtual environment contains all the packages and dependencies specific to your project, and it can be quite large. Instead, you should only push the code and configuration files necessary for your project, and provide a requirements.txt file to manage your dependencies.

Here's what you should do:

Add your virtual environment directory to your .gitignore file. This will prevent Git from tracking the virtual environment's contents. In your case, add the following line to your .gitignore:
Copy code
virtual_environments_smell_like_updog/
Remove the virtual environment directory from your repository:
bash
Copy code
git rm -r --cached virtual_environments_smell_like_updog/
Commit the changes:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Remove virtual environment from repository"
Create a requirements.txt file to list your dependencies. You can use pip freeze to generate this file:
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Add the requirements.txt file to your repository:
sql
Copy code
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"
Push your changes to the remote repository:
perl
Copy code
git push
Now, when someone wants to run your project, they can create their own virtual environment and install the necessary packages using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv my_virtual_env
source my_virtual_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
This approach will keep your repository clean and make it easier for others to work with your code.
